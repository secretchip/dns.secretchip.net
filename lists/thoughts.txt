What this service explicitly does not do

No user profiling
There is no concept of a user in the free tier.

No data resale
DNS data is not sold, shared, or licensed.

No ads
DNS responses are never altered for advertising.

No cross-token tracking
Paid tokens are isolated by design.

No silent policy changes
Blocking logic changes are visible and documented.

Minimal logging
Logs exist only for security, abuse prevention, and paid reporting features.

Short retention by default
Free users have minimal retention. Paid users choose retention length.

Open scrutiny
The lists, categories, and processes are public.

Economic incentive alignment
The service is paid by subscriptions, not by harvesting data.

Core principle

If a feature requires knowing who you are, it does not belong in a Protective DNS service.
